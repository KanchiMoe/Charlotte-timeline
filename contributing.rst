Calculating the timeline has been a fun project and my calculations are based on trying to notice the passage of time, conveniently placed calendars in the background, real world traditions (eg, uniform changes being on set dates), logical guesses (X days seem to have passed), and ultimately assuming that the producers of Charlotte made an active effort to keep the timeline consistent.

I like to think I have accounted for everything, however there easily could be things I have overlooked. 

If you have noticed something that I may have missed, overlooked or got incorrect, please feel free to let me know. I'd love to make sure the timeline is as accurate as possible.
