Episode 1
============

Date
-------

If we assume the show is set in 2015, the first 3 minutes of episode 1 need to take place in 2014. Everything else after this takes place from April 2015 onwards. If we look at the calendar for April 2015, we could estimate that between ``02:55`` and ``08:28`` has been the 6th of April [5]_, ``08:29`` to ``18:26`` on 7th April. [6]_.

We can estimate that the episode end on Wednesday 8th April or Sunday 12th April. [9]_

Yuu is 15 at this point.

.. Attention:: 
    | Tomori holds up Yuu's recent medical exam (``11:01``), dated 15th April. This means the exact dates (6th, 7th, etc) don't fit in. However, it is still safe to say this episode takes place in April. 


Supporting evidence
---------------------

The show opens to show Yuu standing in the street, he looks up and sees a comet passing over. There is no way to determine a date here, but this is not the Charlotte comet itself as detailed in a later episode.

The next shot (``0:55``) shows summer [1]_, autum [2]_ and winter [3]_, then Yuu attending the enterance ceremony [4]_. He and Ayumi are transfered to Hoshinoumi Academy. Yuu and Ayumi then move into the dorms [7]_ [8]_. 

Yuu's age is shown on a medical report that Tomori holds up at ``11:01``. Tomori's estimated age is 15 at this point [10]_.


.. [1] Evidenced by the weather - sunny, cicada sounds, ect.

.. [2] Evidenced by the trees now having yellow leaves, and leaves being on the ground. (``01:22``).

.. [3] Evidenced by students now wearing coats, gloves and scarves at ``02:45``, as Yuu takes the enterance exams. Addationally, in Japan, entrance exams are usually in mid-January/Feburuary [#jpexams]_ so this now needs to be the new year (2015) .

.. [4] In Japan, the school year starts in April. [#jpexams]_

.. [5] Assuming that the school would have it's enterance ceremony on Monday.

.. [6] As an inconsistancy, there is a calendar on the wall at ``22:54`` which has the number "5" shown, to indicate May, but I'm ignoring this per #7 below.

.. [7] There is a calendar at ``23:17``, above Ayumi's head which shows April. The writing is a bit faint, but visible.

.. [8] It appears they spend the entire day moving in, starting in the morning (``18:26``). Tomori and Joujirou are leaving  but Ayumi says she is about to make dinner, implying the evening. [9]_

.. [9] It's not possible to determine when exactly the move into the dorms happened. We could assume it happened the next day (seeing as Hoshinoumi Academy moves quickly (and would have allowed them to not be present at school during the move in)) or at the weekend of that week.

.. [10] Tomori's age is estimated to be 15 based on she is a first year in high school. In Japan, most people start high school when 15. [#jpschoolyrs]_


Episode 2
============

Date
-------

From episode 1, we can still conclude that it is April 2015.

Tomori's flashback (``14:58``) takes place in 2012. A year passes [13]_ and now assumed around or April 2013. Tomori meeting Shunsuke likely happened sometime near this date.

Supporting evidence
---------------------

A calendar is visible at ``00:08``. While the legibility is poor, 

In Tomori's flashback, she mentions she had just passed the middle school [11]_ enterance exams [12]_.  

At ``16:01`` there is calendar behind Tomori and her brother. This seems to have 29 numbers on it. Going back on real world calendars, Feburuary 2012 is a leap year and has 29 days. This puts Tomori's estimated age at this moment as 12.

There isn't any evidence to say when Tomori escaped from the school, only that at least 1 year had passed since she started there.

Calender again says May. (``21:34``)

.. [11] In Japan, middle school [#jpschoolyrs]_ is between ages of 12 to 15.

.. [12] Meaning she would have had to have taken these in January or Feburuary of that year. [#jpexams]_ and started the school in April 2012.

.. [13] In the dub, at ``17:40`` she says "A year later".

Episode 3
============

Date
-------

Estimated to be May 2015. Specific date is unknown. It does appear that the entire episode takes place within one day.

Supporting evidence
---------------------

A calendar on the wall at ``21:30`` shows "5" to indicate May.

Episode 4
============

Date
-------

Still May 2015, with a specific date is unknown. Tomori arranges for the baseball game to be "next Sunday" [14]_.

Supporting evidence
---------------------

A calendar on the wall at ``00:30`` shows "5" to indicate May.

.. [14] The wording here is ambiguous. As everyone is in school uniforms, it implies not the upcoming Sunday, but the following Sunday. If the calendar is correct, this could mean the 13th, 20th or 27th of May 2015 by assuming the upcoming Sunday is the 6th, at a minimum.

Episode 5
============

Date
-------

The episode starts on Thursday 28th May and runs up until ``05:19``. Friday until ``11:37``, Saturday until ``15:22`` and Sunday (31st May) until the end of the episode.


Supporting evidence
---------------------

The evidence for the end date comes from that episode 6 has a uniform change, which takes place on a set date each year [#jpuniform]_. If we track the passage of time using the day-night cycle, we can see that 3 days have passed.

At ``14:42`` on what would be Saturday, Yuu says "tomorrow is Monday, right?" this is taken to be after midnight and "tomorrow" doesn't mean 'the morning to come in a few hours [15]_, but the day after' [16]_. 

At ``14:13`` Yuu and Joujirou talk about how long the powers will remain. He says the powers should be gone by the time they graduate highschool [#jpschoolyrs]_. Yuu comments "2 more years".

.. [15] Seeing as they are sleeping in 4 hour blocks.

.. [16] Any conclift over this date only means the dates on the next episode get pushed back by one.

Episode 6
============

Date
-------

This episode takes place from Monday the 1st of June onwards. 2nd June starts from ``15:02``. 3rd June starts from ``16:46`` until the end of the episode, which means Ayumi dies on the 3rd of June [16]_.

Supporting evidence
---------------------

1st June is determined by the uniform change from winter to summer [#jpuniform]_. This happens on the 1st of June. We see at least 2 day cycles pass.

Episode 7
============

Date
-------

We take that the episode starts the next day (4th June). The date of the funeral is unclear but would have happened as soon as possible [18]_. We can assume this would have taken place anywhere between the 5th of June (Friday) to the 7th (Sunday). Yuu is in a depressive state and runs away, until Tomori finds him. The episode ends still in June 2015 but it is unclear when in June.

Supporting evidence
---------------------

The episode could easily could be on the same day Episode 6 ended on. Tomori says Ayumi attended school from the 3rd period onwards [17]_ [#jpclasstimetable]_, which could put her death at around midday. Yuu wakes up, suggesting some period of unconsciousness, but the legnth is unclear so we shall assume it is the next day.

We see a calendar at ``20:43``. This matches up to June 2015.

.. [17] In the dub, at ``18:18``.
