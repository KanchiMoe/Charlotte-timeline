====================================
Working out the Charlotte timeline
====================================

.. DANGER:: 
    | This project includes major spoilers from the anime `'Charlotte' <https://myanimelist.net/anime/28999>`_. If you have not seen Charlotte yet, it is worth watching it before reading this document.

Charlotte. The 2nd anime original by Jun Maeda, with mixed reviews due to `pacing problems <https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacingProblems>`_ and a rushed ending, among other things.

One of the other issues it has; is the general confusion around it's timeline, because it has time travel elements. 

As part of another project I was working on, that involves Charlotte's timeline, I decided to work out and plot exactly when episodes and events happened.

As a result, the timeline, time travel, flashbacks, etc are all clear to me and I understand what is going on in Charlotte without a problem. I have decided to create this document site to help others.


Visual timeline
==================

In addation to this document, `I have also created a visual timeline using Time.Graphics to aid in visualising the data and timeline I've formed <https://time.graphics/line/566800>`_. This timeline graph should aid where people may get confused with the time travel and flashback elements, particularly from episode 9 onwards.   

.. Important:: 
    | The visual timeline contains hours and minutes in some locations. These are not part of any calculation and are only used for the alignment of segments on the timeline.
